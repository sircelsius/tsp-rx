# RxJava Travelling Salesman Problem

## Goal

Demonstrate how to solve the [TSP](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) both with the [Nearest Neughbour algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm) (NN) and [Simulated Annealing heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) (SA).

## Implementing the SA heuristic

I have added a working implementation of the Simulated Annealing Heuristic. See [`src/main/java/com/sircelsius/rx/service/SimulatedAnnealingHeuristic.java`](src/main/java/com/sircelsius/rx/service/SimulatedAnnealingHeuristic.java) and compare to your implementation!

**Task** Check against your work, test with `./gradlew test`, and propose enhancements!

You've reached the end of the exercise, congrats!
